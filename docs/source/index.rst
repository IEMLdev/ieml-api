Welcome to IEML Library documentation!
======================================


This is the home of the documentation for the Python implementation of the IEML metalanguage. You should find here

 * a brief intro to the theory behind the IEML metalanguage
 * examples on how to use our implementation
 * an API reference

Bear in mind that the project is still under heavy development (and conception). You should use this documentation
as a way to get a better understanding of the IEML project, and a basic overview of our Python implementation's usage.
